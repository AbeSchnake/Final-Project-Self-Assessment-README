# Abe Schnake Final Project Self-Assessment

## Self-Assessment
My main role in this Board Game Analysis project was preparing the data for machine learning and building the K-means supervised machine learning model used to categorize the games. I also provided support to the other members of my team by making sure I knew what they needed from me and that they knew what I needed from them. This included what data to include on the file exported from the database into Jupyter Notebook for my work, which data related to the machine learning categories should be included on the visualization, what the differences were between the data cleaning process for the R analysis and my data cleaning process, and other communcations ensuring everyone was on the same page.

My greatest personal challenge, despite all of that, was in making sure everyone was on the same page. I thought we did a good job as a remote team, but as a team with a completely flat hierarchy and with no in-person contact, there were communication challenges that I had not previously experienced in my professional life.

## Team Assessment
The communication protocol was based around 2 main principles. One, during the times when we weren't meeting, the team members should use Slack to update each other on what they're doing and what progress they've made. Two, when we did conduct out Zoom meetings we would make sure everyone had uninterrupted time to speak and give updates before we moved into more freeform discussion.

Our strengths as a team were our willingness to work well with each other and allow everyone's ideas to have weight. If I were advising a new cohort beginning the group project section of the class, I'd advise that they follow our example in allowing each other uninterrupted speaking time. If anything, I would go further than we did in project communication outside of meetings. I would advise setting up a shared spreadsheet showing what each team member is currently working on that can be updated by each member as they finish tasks.

## Summary of Project:
This project used a K-means machine learning algorithm to categorize a dataset of board games. The machine learning model separated the games into categories that showed clear statistical divisions from one another. During the iterative process of building the model, a hyopthesis about three of the game's weight scores was generated. When the model was run for the final time without weight as an input, the hypothesis was confirmed.
